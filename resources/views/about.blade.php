          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>When an exception is uncaught and the APP_DEBUG environment variable is true, the debug page will show all environment variables and their contents. In some cases you may want to obscure certain variables. You may do this by updating the debug_blacklist option in your config/app.php configuration file.</p>
